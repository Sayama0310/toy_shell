# Toy Shell

Implemented a simple shell for learning purposes.

List of basic features:

- Receive commands from standard input and fork a child process to execute them.
- Execution through pipelines.
- Execution of foreground/background jobs.
- Command history functionality.

## Usage

When you run the `cargo run` command, ToySh will start, and you will have access to a basic shell.

Below is a sample execution:

```shell
$ cargo run  # Start ToySh.
ToySh 😊 > ls  # Execute a command.
Cargo.lock      Cargo.toml      LICENSE         README.md       src             target
ToySh 😊 > ls -a  # Execute a command with arguments.
.                       .git                    .idea                   Cargo.lock              LICENSE                 src
..                      .gitignore              .pre-commit-config.yaml Cargo.toml              README.md               target
ToySh 😊 > ls -la | cat -n | grep .git  # Execute a pipeline.
     4  drwxr-xr-x@ 14 sayama_yusei  staff    448 Jun 18 15:59 .git
     5  -rw-r--r--@  1 sayama_yusei  staff     15 Jun 14 05:30 .gitignore
ToySh 😊 > ls -3  # If the command fails, an angelic halo appears on the prompt.
ls: invalid option -- 3
usage: ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when] [-D format] [file ...]
ToySh 😇 > pwd
/path/to/toy_shell
ToySh 😊 > cd src  # Execute a built-in command.
ToySh 😊 > pwd
/path/to/toy_shell/src
ToySh 😊 > exit 2  # Execute a exit with status

$ echo $?  # Check the exit status of ToySh.
2
```

## Features

### Command History

ToySh has a command history feature that allows you to access the commands you have executed.

When ToySh starts, a file named `.toysh/history` is created under your home directory. If you no longer need it, please
delete it.

### Built-in Commands

ToySh has the following built-in commands:

- `cd` : Change directory.
    - `cd` : No argument is specified, change to the home directory.
    - `cd -` : Change to the previous directory.
    - `cd <dir>` : Change to the specified directory.

- `exit` : Exit ToySh.
    - `exit` : Exit ToySh with status code 0.
    - `exit <status>` : Exit ToySh with the specified status code.

### Pipeline

ToySh supports pipelines.
You can use the pipe operator `|` to connect the standard output of one command to the standard input of another
command.
